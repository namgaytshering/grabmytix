            By using GrabMyTix, you agree to abide by these terms and
            conditions. All ticket purchases, event listings, and interactions on the platform are subject to these
            rules. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of any information provided during registration or
            booking, including personal and payment details. Misuse of the platform, such as unauthorized resale of
            tickets or fraudulent activities, may result in account suspension or legal action. Additionally, users must
            comply with all applicable laws and event-specific policies. We reserve the right to modify these terms at
            any time, and continued use of the platform constitutes acceptance of such changes.

        <h2 class="h4 pt-3 pt-lg-4">Data Privacy and Protection</h2>
        <p  >At GrabMyTix, we prioritize your privacy and take measures to protect your personal data. We collect
            information such as your name, email address, and payment details to process bookings and enhance your
            experience. Your data is used solely for transaction processing, customer support, and personalized offers,
            and it will never be sold to third parties. We implement industry-standard security measures to safeguard
            your information, though we cannot guarantee absolute security. Under applicable laws (e.g., GDPR), you have
            the right to access, correct, or delete your data. To exercise these rights, please contact us at
            support@grabmytix.com .
        </p>
        <h2 class="h4 pt-3 pt-lg-4">User Rights and Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p >As a user, you have certain rights when using GrabMyTix, including the ability to access, update, or request
            deletion of your personal data. If you encounter any issues or disputes related to ticket purchases, we
            encourage resolution through direct communication with our support team. Should disputes remain unresolved,
            they will be handled under Australian law, with mediation or arbitration conducted in New South Wales
            courts. Our liability is limited to the amount paid for tickets, and we are not responsible for indirect
            damages, such as missed events or losses beyond our control. For further assistance, feel free to reach out
            to us via email at support@grabmytix.com or call +61 2 9999 8888 .
